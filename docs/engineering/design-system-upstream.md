# Design System Upstream Notes

The design export in `docs/design_system/` is never edited in this repository
([docs/README.md](../README.md#design-export)). When the demo parity triage decides that the export
is the side to change (a triage cluster's `upstream` action in `.parity-triage.json`), or when the
Vue app needs a value the export draws only as a literal with no token (the `design-system-guard`
skill), the change is written down here instead, as a note to paste into the Claude Design project,
so that the next export carries it. Once an export with the change has been imported, its note is
removed.

Each note names the triage cluster or the skill it comes from, the kit file and the element, what
the export shows, and what it should show, with the reason; behaviour comes from
[`docs/features/ui/`](../features/ui/README.md), visuals from the export's own tokens.

## Notes

None open: the fifth-pass export carries every note written so far.
